This is a TensorFlow implementation of the paper 'Framework for Designing Filters of Spectral Graph Convolutional Neural Networks in the context of Regularization Theory", (https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13801)



 ## Installation

```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Requirements
* tensorflow (>0.12) (Programming is done with version 1.9.0 in Anaconda environment in Windows OS)
* networkx

## Run the demo

```bash
cd gcn
python train.py  
``` 



The implementation is an extension of the implementation codes of the paper by Thomas N. Kipf, Max Welling, [Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907) (ICLR 2017)
